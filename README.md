This is a dataset from Kaggle that contains grayscale images of various clothes items (boots, sandals, shirts, etc) of 10 different classes. I built a classification model in Tensorflow.

An image is taken and reshaped into a 1D vector and normalized. I started with a simple model with 2 hidden layers, and experimented with number and size of hidden layers, gradually increasing the model size to get me to the desired accuracy. I ended up building a model with 4 hidden layers to get me ~89 percent prediction on the testing set. There is still reserve to bump up predictive performance a few more percentage points by making the model bigger, given that the training set performance is 92.5 percent, but this was a simple task with a predictable outcome and I didn't bother to pursue it further.
